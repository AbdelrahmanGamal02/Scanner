## Compiler Design
# Scanner phase implementation using python  
implement the function of Scanner stages that takes stream of characters as input (main code) then generate Tokens that specifiy each line of main code and give this tokens to the next stage (Parser Stage).

# Parser implementation using python  
implement the function of parser stages that takes string and specify if the string is accepted or not based on simple grammar rules.
